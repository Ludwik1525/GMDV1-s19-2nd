# Game Development - Project #2 - KATZE GEFUNDEN
Second project for Game Development course. <br/>
The game is an adventure game where the goal is to collect all the diamond collectibles while avoiding enemies and obstacles on a desert level. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE GAME IS NOT UPLOADED BECAUSE OF TOO LARGE FILES ERRORS.<br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting.
